for the responses.

Algorithms, Processing, and

1b. Program santizies and stores the file as a list
2. Program asks to the user if they would like to shake the 8-ball
2b. Program validates the input and loops back if input is bad.
3. if 2 is entered the progam breaks the loop and jumps to step 6 
4. If 1 is entered the program continues 
4b. Program asks the user for what they'd like to ask the 8-ball and stores
it as a variable
4c. Program uses randint from the random library and uses the response to 
output a print statement with the 8-balls response along with what the User
asked
5. Program jumps to step 2
